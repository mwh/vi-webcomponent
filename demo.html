        <vi-window rows="25" cols="120">This component adds a vi-window element that provides editing of text as as in vi. It will display its text contents, as with a textarea, and provides vi editing operations and modes.

* It is possible to enter insert mode with i, and to exit it with Escape.
* In normal mode, the cursor can be moved with the arrow keys, or with h/j/k/l, or wordwise with w/b/e.
* Lines can be deleted with dd, or yanked with yy, and pasted with p.
* Visual mode with v, visual-line mode with V, or visual-block mode with CTRL-V can be used to select text.
* In visual mode, d will delete the selection.
* In visual-block mode, c will change the selection, or I will insert before it.

In addition to POSIX vi, this component includes extensions from vim and elsewhere:
* Visual character, line, and block modes with v/V/CTRL-V
  * c/d/y will operate on the selection
  * I/A will insert before/after the selection across multiple lines in block mode
  * ap or ip will select the current paragraph
* The + and * registers access the system clipboard
* Macros are recorded into registers with q and executed with @
* An undo and redo stack is accessed through u and CTRL-R
* Multiple simultaneous cursors with CTRL-L j/k/J/K or visual CTRL-L/I/A/C
  * In visual character mode, CTRL-L will add a separate cursor selecting the next occurrence of the selection.
  * In normal mode, CTRL-L j/k extend the cursor below or above, and J/K skip over lines if given a count.

It supports the POSIX vi commands (see https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/vi.html) except:
* Shell command (!)
* Edit alternate (CTRL-^)
* ex mode (Q)
* Redraw (CTRL-R); uses this for redo as in vim
* Redisplay (CTRL-L); uses this for cursor commands
* Z exit commands (useless)
* CTRL-N, CTRL-W, CTRL-T; these are captured by the browser
* The insert-mode CTRL commands
* Section motions ([[ / ]])


While primarily for plain text, it is possible to include
HTML <a href="#tags">links</a> within the body, which will
act as tag names.

In the same way, <a name="tags">an anchor with a name</a> is
a tag, and CTRL-] will jump to it from either an explicit link
or a word matching that name.
